  3. Terms & Availability (move-in date, lease terms, restrictions)
  4. Pricing Intelligence (suggested pricing with comparables)
  5. Listing Preview & Generation
- **💰 Smart Pricing**: Location-based pricing tiers with amenity adjustments and comparable listings
- **💾 Session Persistence**: Conversations are saved and can be resumed after page refresh
- **📱 Modern UI**: Clean, responsive chat interface with typing indicators and smooth animations
